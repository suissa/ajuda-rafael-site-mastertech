<p class="intro">Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations.</p>
<hr>

<h2>What is Multimedia?</h2>
<p>Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see.</p>
<p>Examples: Images, music, 
sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.</p>

<p>Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats. </p>

<p>In this chapter you will learn about the different multimedia formats.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Browser Support</h2>
<p>The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single font in a single color.</p>
<p>Later came browsers with support for colors and fonts, and images!</p>
<p>Audio, video, and animation have been handled differently 
by the major browsers. Different formats have been supported, and some formats require 
extra helper programs (plug-ins) to work.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will become history. HTML5 multimedia promises an easier 
future for multimedia.</p>
<hr><h2>Multimedia Formats</h2>
<p>Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files. </p>
<p>The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file 
extension.</p>
<p>Multimedia files have formats and different extensions 
like: .swf, .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.</p>
